            <h2 id="introduction">What online privacy means</h2>
            <p>
                Online privacy is all about keeping your personal information, habits, and identity safe while using the Net. Just like you wouldn’t share your home address or phone number with a stranger on the street, it’s important to be careful about what you share online. Some websites, like Facebook or Instagram, are designed for sharing, but that doesn’t mean you have to give away everything about yourself. In this section, we’ll go over the basics of protecting your privacy, what information is safe to share, and how to make smart choices about what you post or reveal online. The goal is to help you feel confident and secure as you explore the digital world.

            <p>
                Protecting your personal information online means thinking before you share. 
                Details like your full name, address, phone number, or financial information should be kept private, especially on public websites or social media. 
                Scammers and hackers are always looking for easy targets, and sharing too much can make you vulnerable. 
                Use strong, unique passwords for each account, and never reuse the same password across different sites. 
                Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password. 
                Be cautious with links and attachments, especially if you don't recognize the sender. These can be tricks to steal your information or infect your device with malware. 
                When in doubt, it's always safer to keep personal details to yourself.

            <h2 id="privacy-settings">Understanding privacy settings</h2>
            <p>
                Most websites and social media platforms have privacy settings that let you control who can see your information and posts. 
                It's a good idea to take a few minutes to explore these settings whenever you join a new site. 
                For example, you can often make your profile private so only approved friends can see your updates, or you can limit who can send you messages. 
                Some sites let you choose exactly what information is visible to others, like your birthday or email address. 
                Regularly checking and updating your privacy settings helps you stay in control of your online presence. 
                If you want to share photos or updates with just your friends and family, making your profile private is a smart move. 
                Remember, you can always change your settings later if you want to share more or less.

            <h2 id="cookies-tracking">Cookies and tracking explained</h2>
            <p>
                Cookies are small pieces of data that websites save on your computer to remember things like your login status, preferences, or what's in your shopping cart. 
                While cookies can make browsing easier, they can also be used to track your activity across different sites, often for advertising purposes. 
                That's why you might see ads for something you searched for days ago! 
                Many websites now ask for your permission to use cookies, and you can usually manage or delete them in your browser's settings. 
                If you're concerned about being tracked, you can use privacy-focused browsers or add-ons that block tracking cookies. 
                It's a good habit to clear your cookies every so often, especially if you're using a shared or public computer.

            <p>
                Social media is a great way to stay in touch with friends and family, but it's important to be mindful of what you share. 
                Avoid posting personal details like your address, phone number, or travel plans in public posts. 
                Be careful with photos, too. Sometimes a picture can reveal more than you intend, like your location or other private details in the background. 
                Only accept friend or follow requests from people you know, and don't be afraid to block or report suspicious accounts. 
                Most platforms have privacy tools that let you control who can see your posts, tag you in photos, or send you messages. 
                Take a few minutes to review these settings and adjust them to your comfort level. 
                Finally, check your account activity from time to time and remove any unfamiliar devices or sessions to keep your account secure.
