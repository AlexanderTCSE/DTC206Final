            <h2 id="introduction">Why online safety matters</h2>
            <p>
                According to a report by the FBI, complaints of elder fraud increased by 14% in 2023 and the associated losses also increased by 11%.
                In dollars, this adds up to over $3.4 billion in losses in 2023 alone. The average victim of elder fraud lost $33,915 due to online scams and similar crimes. 
                Staying safe online can save you from incredibly costly mistakes, as well as from wasted time on the phone trying to recover your identity or credit card information.
                The best way to fix this kind of situation is to avoid it entirely, so in this section we will be reviewing some important ideas about staying safe and protected on the internet.

            <h2 id="scams-phishing">Scams and Phishing</h2>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, dishonest people on the internet spend a lot of time and effort trying to scam unaware users out of their personal information. 
                You will learn how to spot and avoid such scams. "Phishing" is a common type of online scam in which a malicious entity attempts to trick you into revealing sensitive information
                by pretending to be somebody that you trust. Attempts at phishing scams can come in the form of e-mails, text messages, phone calls, and more. Often, they will use urgent language
                trying to convince you that some account has been compromised and that you need to take quick action to fix it by providing your password or other login information. Always be certain
                to verify where these messages are coming from. If it is an e-mail, look at the sender's address carefullyâ€”scammers often use addresses that look similar to legitimate ones but may have extra characters or misspellings. 
                Never click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown sources. When in doubt, contact the company or person directly using a trusted method, not the contact information provided in the suspicious message.

            <p>
                There are a few ways to protect yourself from common scams by taking extra precautions online.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Always keep your computer and cell phone software up to date. Scammers are fighting an ongoing battle with big tech companies like Apple to get past their filters. If you have out-of-date software, it may not have critical security features.</li>
                <li>Protect your computer with security software. Windows computers come with windows defender built-in, but antivirus software can provide an extra layer of protection.</li>
                <li>When possible, protect your accounts by enabling multi-factor authentication. Some platforms let users receive a one-time passcode to get into their account or even use biometrics like your fingerprint to verify that the person trying to log in really is you.</li>
                <li><strong>Back up your data!</strong> Keep backups of important things like documents or pictures on the cloud, or even better - on a separate physical hard drive.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="what-to-do">How can I report scams?</h2>
            <p>
                If you think you've been the victim of an online scam or phishing attack, don't worry. There are several ways to report the cybercriminal and protect your data.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you believe the scammer already has your information, you can file a report at <a href="https://www.identitytheft.gov/Info-Lost-or-Stolen" target="_blank">IdentityTheft.gov</a>
                and see what steps to take based on your situation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you think your computer has been infected by malicious software, try running a security scan with something like
                <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank">MalwareBytes</a> to remove the virus. Other antivirus software is available online, I just have good experience with MalwareBytes.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you've received a phishing e-mail or text message, report it. E-mails can be forwarded to the Anti-Phishing Working Group at <a href="mailto:reportphishing@apwg.org">reportphishing@apwg.org</a>
                Phishing text messages can be forwarded to SPAM (7726). In addition, you can report the attempt to the FTC at <a href="https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/" target="_blank">ReportFraud.ftc.gov</a>.
                The information you share to these organizations helps fight scammers and helps prevent others from losing valuable data.
